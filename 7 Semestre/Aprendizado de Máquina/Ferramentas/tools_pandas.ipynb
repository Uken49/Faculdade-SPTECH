When we interpolate for November, we get the mean: 1 bonus point. Colin had 1 bonus point in November, but we do not know how many bonus points he had in September, so we cannot interpolate, this is why there is still a missing value in October after interpolation. To fix this, we can set the September bonus points to 0 before interpolation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"QlCK6WFuojSq","outputId":"666b7fbd-ff62-4a34-8af0-94a5d360a09d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675354933555,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":101,"user":{"displayName":"Americo Talarico Neto","userId":"03851012364484696881"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["         sep  oct  nov  dec\n","bob      0.0  0.0  1.0  2.0\n","colin    0.0  0.5  1.0  0.0\n","darwin   0.0  0.0  1.0  0.0\n","charles  0.0  3.0  3.0  0.0\n","alice    0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-f7fe256b-7e97-477c-80c5-c4fc5efbef76\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>sep</th>\n","      <th>oct</th>\n","      <th>nov</th>\n","      <th>dec</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>bob</th>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>2.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>colin</th>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.5</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>darwin</th>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>charles</th>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>alice</th>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-f7fe256b-7e97-477c-80c5-c4fc5efbef76')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-f7fe256b-7e97-477c-80c5-c4fc5efbef76 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
